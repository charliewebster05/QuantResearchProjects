# Quantitative Research Projects – Macro-Inspired Strategies

Welcome to my collection of quantitative finance research projects, where I explore how macroeconomic forces shape markets and how data can help uncover those relationships. This repository documents my independent work and experiments in building trading strategies, illustrating macroeconomic trends and any other general interests around these topics.

# Philosophy

This repository is a reflection of my passion for quantitative finance and macroeconomic* — where market structure meets economic cycles, and data-driven thinking leads to insight.

I'm particularly fascinated by:
- How macro variables like interest rates and inflation ripple through asset classes
- The predictive power of economic indicators on sector performance
- Building systems that make sense of the "why" behind market movements, not just the "what"

Each project is part of an ongoing journey to bridge my academic macro knowledge with systematic investing practice.
